    <p> Growing up in India, I was continually exposed to the political interactions taking place in the world around me and became increasingly fascinated with the way power relations move and how these movements are represented in a literary context. I found myself constantly searching for how power relations have historically been represented through the works of literature and political theory and how they are predicted to unfold (primarily through political theory and dystopian novels). 
    </p>
   
    <p> Through my writing and research, I hope to explore the correlations between literature, political theory and real-world events. My work has ranged from academic writing (primarily in the form of research, analytical and opinion pieces) to creative forms of writing such as short stories. </p>
