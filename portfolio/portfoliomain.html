 <h1> Welcome to My Portfolio!</h1>
    <p> My portfolio includes a range of works from creative short stories to analytical and research papers. While my academic pieces veer towards the analytical through my research and textual analysis as part of both of my majors, my creative and professional writing pieces primarily engage with storytelling (particularly the preservation of storytelling traditions).    The topics of these pieces primarily engage with various forms of folklore as I explore the different societies that engage with and consume traditional folklore.

    <h2> Academic Work</h2>
<p> My academic writing ranges from analytical to research-based writing. This is largely due to the dichotomy in the types of pieces I am assigned in both my majors. While the pieces I write for my English major tend to involve engagement with the texts we read in class and the analysis of pieces, the pieces I write for my Political Science classes tend to be more argumentative and research-based. These pieces emphasize my adaptability as a writer due to the differences in writing styles.  </p>

        <h2> Creative Work</h2>
<p> My creative works range from pieces I produced during classes to pieces I wrote for publication. One of these works is a creative writing portfolio of pieces I collected during the semester during a class I took on American Romanticismâ€”this includes pieces I wrote as well as the reviews I received and implemented during this course. The other piece is a collection of  Ladakhi folktales that I converted into short stories for children in 2021.

        <h2> Professional Work</h2>
    <p> My professional works consist primarily of pieces I produced as part of my certificate in Professional Writing and Technical Communications. The flagship piece of this section of my portfolio is the Mock Grant Proposal project I researched and wrote on. The piece advocates for the necessity of a mobile library providing traditional folktales and performance techniques to the children of migrant workers in India moving with their parents to larger cities.
