        <p>This is a document to help interested travelers plan their trip to Delhi!</p>

        <h2> Cultural Bazaar</h2>
        <h3> Dastakar </h3>

        <p>A cultural bazaar near the border between Delhi and Gurgaon, Dastakar Delhi features a curated list of artisans from across India in a series of themed events that typically last a few weeks. If you are exploring Delhi  during the springtime, be sure to visit their Holi and Basant festivals to enjoy exploring the colorful realm of traditional handicrafts!    </p>
        <h3> Dilli Haat</h3>

 </figure>
        <p> Where Dastkar operates by event (Meaning it is not open to visitors all year round), Dilli Haat is a similar shopping area featuring tradional handicrafts. Although they often invite new artisans because of themed events, this market is open throughout the year (And you can bargain prices here). 
            <br>
            <br>
            <b> Warning: Travellers visiting these places during the summer months, please be sure to wear clothes that keep you cool.</b>

        <p> The world's tallest brick minaret and a UNESCO world heritage site that was built by Qutubuddin Aibaq ( A sultan during Delhi's sultanate period that lasted from about 1206 A.D. to 1526 A.D). The minaret is surrounded by the ruins of Lal Kot, one of the major cities during this time period. Be sure to prebook tickets and travel by auto-rickshaw (Also known as tuk-tuk) as the crowds make it difficult to find parking nearby. </p>
        <h3> Humayun's Tomb</h3>
        <figure>

        <p> Humayun's Tomb is the resting place of one of the first Mughal emperors. The tomb, which was built using red sandstone and black and white marble,  is believed to have been designed by his son, Jalaluddin Akbar. The tomb is also believed to have been one of the primary inspirations for the design of the Taj Mahal (That was designed by Akbar's grandson- Shah Jahan) as it looks like a red Taj Mahal. </p>
        <h3> Safdarjung's Tomb </h3>
        <figure>

        </figure>
        <p> Safdarjung's Tomb is situated in New Delhi and features the perfect example of the later styles of Mughal Architecture. The boundary walls and tomb display intricate carvings and artwork from the latter part of the Mughal Era.  </p>
