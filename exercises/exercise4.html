    <h1> Possible Images for my Website</h1>
    <h2> Written Work</h2>
    I am considering using this image on a tab where I talk about my written work. I liked this image because I do tend to plan projects in a notebook, and I thought this image was a good representation of this.

<h2> "Under Construction" Page</h2>
I love dogs. So I thought it might be nice to leave people with a cute dog to look at while the website is under construction as the image is unmoving (so it won't be uncomfortable for website users with disabilities).

<h2> Bio Page picture</h2>
I intend to use this picture in my bio page, but I am considering replacing it with another one.
