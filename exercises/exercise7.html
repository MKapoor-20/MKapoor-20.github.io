Academic Paper on Legislation in Old English
        </h2>
        <p>
This paper examines the use of the word <i> unrihte</i> in <i> Beowulf</i> by considering its use as legal terminology. The paper explores whether the use of the word <i> unrihte</i> refers to a legal wrong, or whether the use of this word points to the beginnings of religious morality in Anglo-Saxon England ( in other words, how is the poet measuring 'rightness' in this portion of the text?).
